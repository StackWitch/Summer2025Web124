  <title>Analog + Digital Clock</title>
  <!--
  Sadie Coleman - 2025-07-06
  Project: JavaScript30 #2 Clock - Improved Version

  Credits:
  - Clock structure and functionality inspired by Wes Bos's JavaScript30 #2 Clock
  - Improvements and documentation inspired by Professor Lisa Fredrickson's demo at Johnson County Community College

  What was new or challenging:
  - Switched unique elements from classes to IDs for semantic correctness
  - Structured clock layout with analog clock on top and digital clock below
  - Added meta tags for author and date to meet documentation requirements

  Significant improvements made:
  - Reorganized HTML to use IDs for hour, minute, and second hands
  - Added digital time element below analog clock for better user experience
